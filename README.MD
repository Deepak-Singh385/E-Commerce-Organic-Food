# Project

The E-Commerce Food Website is designed to enable customers to view, select, and order food items online from various vendors or restaurants. The system streamlines the food ordering process and eliminates the need for physical visits, ensuring fast, convenient, and contactless transactions. It is scalable and adaptable for future integration of payment gateways, user login systems, and delivery tracking.
